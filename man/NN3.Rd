\description{
Monthly time series from the NN3 forecasting competition.
Data Type: Empirical business time series. Category: Benchmark. Observations: 50 to 126 per series, 111 series.
The dataset contains 111 univariate monthly time series from real business processes.
Each series has between 50 and 126 observations. Participants were asked to forecast the next 18 values, and performance was evaluated using the mean sMAPE across all series.
