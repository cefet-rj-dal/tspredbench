\description{
Half-hourly electrical load time series from the EUNITE forecasting competition.
Data Type: Electrical load measurements. Category: Benchmark. Observations: 730 days, 48 intervals per day.
This dataset contains univariate time series with half-hour resolution covering 1997–1998. It was used to forecast daily maximum loads in January 1999.
Competitors were evaluated using MAPE and MAXIMAL prediction errors. Regressors such as temperature and calendar variables were also provided.
