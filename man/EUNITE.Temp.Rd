\description{
Average daily temperatures collected for the EUNITE load‑forecasting competition.
Data Type: Meteorological measurements. Category: Benchmark. Observations: 1,461.
The series covers 1995‑1998 and was used as an exogenous regressor for predicting maximum daily electrical loads.
Participants were asked to forecast January 1999 values.
