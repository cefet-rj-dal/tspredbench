\description{
Univariate time series from the CATS (Competition on Artificial Time Series) benchmark.
Data Type: Artificial time series with missing blocks. Category: Benchmark. Observations: 5,000 (4,900 known, 100 missing).
The dataset contains five non-consecutive blocks of 20 missing values each. Competitors were asked to predict these 100 unknown points, and performance was evaluated using MSE (E1 for all unknowns and E2 for the first 80 points).
